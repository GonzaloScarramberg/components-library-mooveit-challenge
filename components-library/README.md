# GS UI Library

Welcome to the **GS UI library**! The react component library that you've been waiting for!

## Getting started

The first step to use the **GS UI library** is to install the package in your package json. To do that you have to run:

`npm install gs-ui-library`

Once you have the package installed, you will notice that react >= 17.0.1, react-dom >= 17.0.1 and styled components >= 5.2.2 are peer dependencies.

To install them you just have to run:

```
npm install react
npm install react-dom
npm install styled-components
```

With the library already installed in your project, you can use the components like this:

```
import { GSButton } from 'gs-ui-library'
<GSButton color="primary" size="small" />
```

That's it! this is all you need to use the components
